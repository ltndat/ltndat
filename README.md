# Cloud-Native Full Stack Engineer

I'm a full stack engineer with a product-first mindset and a systemized learning approach.

I don’t just build apps — I design internal systems to help me (and my team) learn faster, build faster, and scale better.  
I use tools like **React, Node.js, Django, AWS, and GCP** to ship **clean, scalable, cloud-native applications**.

Currently leading [**@Faberio**](https://github.com/faberiohq) as **Technical Lead**, where I apply these systems in real-world product pipelines — designed with [**@Auxon Lab**](https://github.com/auxonlab) principles.

Always open to meaningful remote opportunities where I can bring **systems thinking, fast execution, and a builder’s mindset** to the team.
